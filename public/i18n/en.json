Please note that in addition to the regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b) GDPR )</strong> - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract at the data subject's request.</li> <li><strong>Legitimate interests ( Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 Letter f) GDPR)</strong> - the processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject Protection of personal data requires, not overrides.</li> </ul> <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes in particular the law to protect against misuse of personal data during data processing (Federal Data Protection Act – BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission and automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p> <h2 id='m27'>Safety measures</h2> We take security measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the type, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p> <p>The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, distribution, ensuring availability and their separation. We have also set up procedures to ensure that the rights of those affected are exercised, data are deleted and responses are made to data threats. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account when developing or selecting hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.</p> <p>Securing online connections using TLS/SSL -Encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect user data transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the Internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby protecting the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the advanced and more secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transfers meet the highest security standards. If a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate, this is signaled by displaying HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is transmitted securely and encrypted.</p> <h2 id='m12'>General information on data storage and deletion</h2> <p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with the legal provisions as soon as the underlying consent is revoked or there are no further legal bases for the processing. This applies to cases in which the original purpose of processing no longer applies or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist if legal obligations or special interests require longer storage or archiving of the data.</p> <p>In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons, must be archived accordingly.</p> <p>Our data protection notices contain additional information on the storage and deletion of data that specifically applies to certain processing processes.</p> <p>If there is more than one piece of information When it comes to the retention period or deletion periods of a date, the longest period always applies.</p> <p>If a period does not explicitly begin on a specific date and is at least one year, it starts automatically at the end of the calendar year in which the period triggering the period event has occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in which data is stored, the event that triggers the deadline is the time when the termination or other termination of the legal relationship takes effect.</p> <p>Data that is no longer used for the originally intended purpose, but due to legal requirements or other reasons, we only process it for the reasons that justify its storage.</p> <p><strong>Further information on processing processes, procedures and services:</strong></p> <ul class='m-elements'> <li><strong>Storage and deletion of data: </strong>The following general deadlines apply to the Storage and archiving according to German law: <ul> <li>10 years - retention period for books and records, annual financial statements, inventories, management reports, opening balance sheets as well as the work instructions and other organizational documents, accounting documents and invoices required for their understanding (Section 147 Paragraph 3 i .
